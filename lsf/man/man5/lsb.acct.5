.SH NAME
\fBlsb.acct\fR - Batch job log file of openlava 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR
.PP
.PP
The master batch daemon (see mbatchd(8)) generates a record for each 
job completion or failure. The record is appended to the job log file 
lsb.acct. The file is located in LSB_SHAREDIR/\fI<clustername>\fR/logdir, where 
LSB_SHAREDIR must be defined in lsf.conf(5) and \fI<clustername>\fR is the 
name of the openlava cluster, as returned by lsid(1). See mbatchd(8) for the 
description of LSB_SHAREDIR. The job log file is an ASCII file with one 
record per line. The fields of a record are separated by blanks. If the 
value of some field is unavailable, "" is logged for character string, 0 for 
time and number, and -1 for resource usage.
