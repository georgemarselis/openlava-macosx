.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR
.PP
.PP
\fB\fRDisplays information about hosts.
.PP
By default, returns the following information about all hosts: host 
name, host status, job slot limits, and job state statistics.
.PP
The -s option displays information about the numeric shared 
resources and their associated hosts.
.SH OPTIONS

\fB-w
\fR
.IP
Displays host information in wide format. Fields are displayed without 
truncation.


.TP 
\fB-l
\fR
.IP
Displays host information in a (long) multi-line format. In addition to 
the default fields, displays information about the CPU factor, the 
dispatch windows, the current load, and the load thresholds.


.TP

requirement expression. For more information about resource 
requirements, see lsfintro(1). The size of the resource requirement 
string is limited to 512 bytes.

reserved on the host. 

.RE
.SS Host-Based \fB-\fRl Option
.BR
.PP
.PP
In addition to the above fields, the -l option also displays the 
following:

.IP
STATUS
.BR
.RS

.IP
closed
.BR
.RS
.IP
The long format shown by the -l option gives the possible 
reasons for a host to be closed: 


.IP
closed_Adm 
.BR
.RS
.IP
The host is closed by the openlava administrator or root (see 
badmin(8)). No job can be dispatched to the host, but jobs 
that are executing on the host will not be affected. 

.RE

.IP
closed_Lock 
.BR
.RS
.IP
The host is locked by the openlava administrator or root (see 
lsadmin(8)). All batch jobs on the host are suspended by 
openlava. 

.RE

.IP
closed_Wind 
.BR
.RS
.IP
The host is closed by its dispatch windows, which are 
defined in the configuration file lsb.hosts(5). All batch 
jobs on the host are suspended by the openlava system. 

.RE

.IP
closed_Full 
.BR
.RS
.IP
The configured maximum number of batch job slots on the 
host has been reached (see MAX field below). 

.RE

.IP
closed_Excl 
.BR
.RS
.IP
The host is currently running an exclusive job. 

.RE

.IP
closed_Busy 
.BR
.RS
.IP
The host is overloaded, because some load indices go 
beyond the configured thresholds (see lsb.hosts(5)). 
The displayed thresholds that cause the host to be busy are 
preceded by an asterisk (*). 

.RE

.IP
closed_LIM
.BR
.RS
.IP
LIM on the host is unreachable, but SBD is ok. 

.RE
.RE
.RE

.IP
CPUF
.BR
.RS
.IP
Displays the CPU normalization factor of the host (see 
lshosts(1)). 

.RE

.IP
DISPATCH_WINDOWS 
.BR
.RS
.IP
Displays the dispatch windows for each host. The dispatch 
windows are the time windows during the week when batch jobs 
can be run on each host. Jobs already started are not affected by 
the dispatch windows. The default for the dispatch window is no 
restriction or always open (that is, twenty-four hours a day and 
seven days a week). For the dispatch window specification, see the 
description for the DISPATCH_WINDOWS keyword under the -l 
option in bqueues(1). 

.RE

.IP
CURRENT LOAD
.BR
.RS
.IP
Displays the total and reserved host load. 


.IP
Reserved
.BR
.RS
.IP
You specify reserved resources by using bsub -R (see 
lsfintro(1)). These resources are reserved by jobs running 
on the host.

.RE

.IP
Total
.BR
.RS
.IP
The total load has different meanings depending on whether 
the load index is increasing or decreasing. 

.IP
For increasing load indices, such as run queue lengths, CPU 
utilization, paging activity, logins, and disk I/O, the total load 
is the consumed plus the reserved amount. The total load is 
calculated as the sum of the current load and the reserved load. 
The current load is the load seen by lsload(1).

.IP
For decreasing load indices, such as available memory, idle 
time, available swap space, and available space in tmp, the total 
load is the available amount. The total load is the difference 
between the current load and the reserved load. This difference 
is the available resource as seen by lsload(1). 

.RE
.RE
.RE

.IP
LOAD THRESHOLD
.BR
.RS
.IP
Displays the scheduling threshold loadSched and the suspending 
threshold loadStop. Also displays the migration threshold if 
defined and the checkpoint support if the host supports 
checkpointing.

.IP
The format for the thresholds is the same as for batch job queues 
(see bqueues(1)) and lsb.queues(5)). For an explanation of the 
thresholds\fB \fRand load indices, see the description for the "QUEUE 
SCHEDULING PARAMETERS" keyword under the -l option in 
bqueues(1). 

.RE
.SS Resource-Based \fB-\fRs Option 
.BR
.PP
.PP
The \fB-\fRs option displays the following: the amounts used for scheduling, 
the amounts reserved, and the associated hosts for the shared 
resources. Only shared resources with numeric values are displayed.

resources. 
.PP
The following fields are displayed: 

.IP
RESOURCE 
.BR
.RS
.IP
The name of the resource. 

.RE

.IP
TOTAL

.IP
The value of the shared resource used for scheduling. This is the 
sum of the current and the reserved load for the shared resource. 

.RE

.IP

.BR
.RS
.IP
The amount reserved by jobs. You specify the reserved resource 
using bsub -R (see lsfintro(1)).
