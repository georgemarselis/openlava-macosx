.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR
.PP
.PP
Migrates one or more of your checkpointable and rerunnable jobs. openlava 
administrators and root can migrate jobs submitted by other users.
.PP
By default, migrates one job, the most recently submitted job, or the 
most recently submitted job that also satisfies other specified options 
(-u and -J). Specify 0 (zero) to migrate multiple jobs.
.PP
To migrate a job, both hosts must be binary compatible, run the same 
OS version, have access to the executable, have access to all open files 
(openlava must locate them with an absolute path name), and have access 
to the checkpoint directory.
.PP
Only started jobs can be migrated (i.e., running or suspended jobs); 
pending jobs cannot be migrated.
.PP
When a checkpointable job is migrated, openlava checkpoints and kills the 
job (similar to the -k option of bchkpnt(1)) then restarts it on the next 
available host. If checkpoint is not successful, the job is not killed and 
remains on the host. If a job is being checkpointed when bmig is 
issued, the migration is ignored. This situation may occur if periodic 
checkpointing is enabled.
.PP
When a rerunnable job is migrated, openlava kills the job (similar to 
bkill(1)) then restarts it from the beggining on the next available host.
.PP
The environment variable LSB_RESTART is set to Y when a migrating 
job is restarted or rerun.
.PP
A job is made rerunnable by specifying the -r option on the command 
line using bsub(1) and bmod(1), or automatically by configuring 
RERUNNABLE in lsb.queues(5).
.PP
A job is made checkpointable by specifying the location of a 
checkpoint directory on the command line using the -k option of 
bsub(1) and bmod(1), or automatically by configuring CHKPNT in 
lsb.queues(5).
.SH OPTIONS
.BR
.PP
.TP 
\fB-f
\fR
.IP
Forces a checkpointable job to be checkpointed even if 
non-checkpointable conditions exist (these conditions are OS-specific).


.TP 
\fIjob_ID\fR | \fB"\fR\fIjob_ID\fR\fB[\fR\fIindex_list\fR\fB]"\fR | \fB0
\fR
.IP
Specifies the job ID of the jobs to be migrated. The -J and -u options 
are ignored.

.IP
If you specify a job ID of \fB0\fR (zero), all other job IDs are ignored, and 
all jobs that satisfy the -J and -u options are migrated.

.IP
If you do not specify a job ID, the most recently submitted job that 
satisfies the -J and -u options is migrated.


.TP 
\fB-J\fR \fIjob_name
\fR
.IP
Specifies the job name of the job to be migrated. Ignored if a job ID 
other than 0 (zero) is specified.


.TP 
\fB-m\fR "\fIhost_name\fR ...\fB"\fR | \fB-m\fR \fB"\fR\fIhost_group\fR ...\fB"
\fR
.IP
Only migrates jobs dispatched to the specified hosts.


.TP 
\fB-u\fR \fB"\fR\fIuser_name\fR\fB"\fR | \fB-u\fR \fB"\fR\fIuser_group\fR\fB"\fR | \fB-u all
\fR
.IP
Specifies that only jobs submitted by these users are to be migrated.

.IP
If the reserved user name all is specified, jobs submitted by all users 
are to be migrated. Ignored if a job ID other than 0 (zero) is specified.


.TP

.IP
Prints command usage to stderr and exits.


.TP
