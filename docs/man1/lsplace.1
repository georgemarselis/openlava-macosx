.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR
.PP
.PP
\fB\fRDisplays hosts available for the execution of tasks, and temporarily 
increases the load on these hosts (to avoid sending too many jobs to 
the same host in quick succession). The inflated load will decay slowly 
over time before the real load produced by the dispatched task is 
reflected in the LIM's load information. Host names may be duplicated 
for multiprocessor hosts, to indicate that multiple tasks can be placed 
on a single host.
.PP
By default, displays only one host name.
.PP
By default, uses openlava default resource requirements.
.SH OPTIONS
.BR
.PP
.TP 
\fB-L\fR 

.IP
Attempts to place tasks on as few hosts as possible. This is useful for 
distributed parallel applications in order to minimize communication 
costs between tasks.


.TP 
\fB-n \fR\fIminimum\fR | \fB-n 0\fR 

.IP
Displays at least the specified number of hosts. Specify 0 to display as 
many hosts as possible. 

.IP
Prints Not enough host(s) currently eligible and exits with 
status 1 if the required number of hosts holding the required resources 
cannot be found. 


.TP 
\fB-R\fR\fI \fR\fIres_req\fR 

.IP
Displays only hosts with the specified resource requirements.


.TP 
\fB-w\fR\fI \fR\fImaximum\fR | \fB-w 0\fR 

.IP
Displays no more than the specified number of hosts. Specify 0 to 
display as many hosts as possible. 


.TP 
\fIhost_name\fR ...

.IP
Displays only hosts that are among the specified hosts. 


.TP 
\fB-h
\fR
.IP
Prints command usage to stderr and exits. 


.TP 
\fB-V\fR 

.IP
Prints openlava release version to stderr and exits. 


.SH EXAMPLES
.BR
.PP
.PP
lsplace is mostly used in backquotes to pick out a host name which 
is then passed to other commands. 
.PP
The -w and -n options can be combined to specify the upper and 
lower bounds in processors to be returned, respectively. For example, 
the command lsplace -n 3 -w 5 returns at least 3 and not more than 
5 host names.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.BR
.PP
.PP
lsplace returns 1 if insufficient hosts are available. The exit status is 
-10 if a problem is detected in openlava, -1 for other errors, otherwise 0.
