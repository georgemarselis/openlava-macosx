.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR
.PP
.PP
Switches one or more of your unfinished jobs to the specified queue. 
openlava administrators and root can switch jobs submitted by other users.
.PP
By default, switches one job, the most recently submitted job, or the 
most recently submitted job that also satisfies other specified options 
(-m, -q, -u and -J). Specify -0 (zero) to switch multiple jobs.
.PP
The switch operation can be done only if a specified job is acceptable 
to the new queue as if it were submitted to it, and, in case the job has 
been dispatched to a host, if the host can be used by the new queue. 
If the switch operation is unsuccessful, the job stays where it is.
.PP
If a switched job has not been dispatched, then its behavior will be as 
if it were submitted to the new queue in the first place.
.PP
If a switched job has been dispatched, then it will be controlled by the 
loadSched and loadStop vectors, PRIORITY, RUN_WINDOW and 
other configuration parameters of the new queue, but its nice value and 
resource limits will remain the same except the RUNLIMIT which is 
reset to the value of the new queue.
.PP
This command is useful to change a job's attributes inherited from the 
queue.
