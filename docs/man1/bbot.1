.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR
.PP
.PP
\fB\fRChanges the queue position of a pending job, or a pending job array 
element, to affect the order in which jobs are considered for dispatch. 
.PP
By default, openlava dispatches jobs in a queue in the order of arrival (that 
is, first-come-first-served), subject to availability of suitable server 
hosts. 
.PP
The bbot command allows users and the openlava administrator to manually 
change the order in which jobs are considered for dispatch. Users can 
only operate on their own jobs, whereas the openlava administrator can 
operate on any user's jobs. Users can only change the relative position 
of their own jobs. 
.PP
If invoked by the openlava administrator, \fBbbot\fR moves the selected job after 
the last job with the same priority submitted to the queue. The 
positions of all users' jobs in the queue can be changed by the openlava 
administrator.
.PP
If invoked by a regular user, \fBbbot\fR moves the selected job after the last 
job with the same priority submitted by the user to the queue. 
.PP
Pending jobs are displayed by bjobs in the order in which they will be 
considered for dispatch.

.SH OPTIONS
.BR
.PP
.TP 
\fIjob_ID\fR | \fB"\fR\fIjob_ID\fR\fB[\fR\fIindex_list\fR\fB]"
\fR
.IP
Required. Job ID of the job or job array on which to operate. 

.IP
For a job array, the index list, the square brackets, and the quotation 
marks are required. An index list is used to operate on a job array. The 
index list is a comma separated list whose elements have the syntax 
\fIstart_index\fR[-\fIend_index\fR[\fB:\fR\fIstep\fR]] where \fIstart_index\fR, \fIend_index\fR and \fIstep\fR 
are positive integers. If the step is omitted, a step of one is assumed. 
The job array index starts at one. The maximum job array index is 1000. 
All jobs in the array share the same job_ID and parameters. Each 
element of the array is distinguished by its array index.


.TP 
\fIposition
\fR
.IP
Optional. The \fIposition\fR argument can be specified to indicate where in 
the queue the job is to be placed. \fIposition\fR is a positive number that 
indicates the target position of the job from the end of the queue. The 
positions are relative to only the applicable jobs in the queue, 
depending on whether the invoker is a regular user or the openlava 
administrator. The default value of 1 means the position is after all 
other jobs with the same priority. 


.TP 
\fB-h
\fR
.IP
Prints command usage to stderr and exits. 


.TP 
\fB-V
