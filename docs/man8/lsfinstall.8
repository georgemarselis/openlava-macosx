.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR
.PP
.PP
\fBlsfinstall\fR runs the LSF installation scripts and configuration utilities 
to install a new LSF Standard Edition cluster. To install a fully 
operational LSF cluster that all users can access, you should install as 
root. You can install as a non-root user, with limitations, described in 
Non-root installation.

.SS What lsfinstall does
.BR
.PP
.PP
Before installing and configuring LSF, \fBlsfinstall\fR checks the 
installation prerequisites, and outputs the results to lsfprechk.rpt. 
\fBlsfinstall\fR writes any unrecoverable errors to the Install.err 
file and exits. You must correct these errors before continuing to 
install and configure LSF.
.PP
During installation, \fBlsfinstall\fR logs installation progress in the 
\fBInstall.log \fRfile, calls other utilities to uncompress, extract and copy 
LSF files, and configures the cluster. After 
installation, you must use the \fBhostsetup\fR script to set up each LSF 
server host in the cluster. After setting up the LSF hosts, you should start 
your cluster and test the installation by running some basic LSF 
commands.
.SS Where lsfinstall is located
.BR
.PP
.PP
\fBlsfinstall\fR is included in the LSF installation script tar file 
lsf4.2_lsfinstall.tar.Z and is located in the 
lsf4.2_lsfinstall directory created when you uncompress and 
extract installation script tar file.
.PP
After LSF installation, \fBlsfinstall\fR is located in 
LSF_TOP/4.2/lsfinstall/.

Plan your installation by choosing:
.RS
.HP 2
\(bu An LSF installation directory on file server (e.g., 
LSF_TOP="/usr/share/lsf")
.HP 2
\(bu LSF hosts (master host, server hosts, and client-only hosts; e.g., 
LSF_ADDSERVERS="hosta hostb hostc")
.HP 2
\(bu A cluster name (39 characters or less with no white spaces; e.g., 
LSF_CLUSTER_NAME="cluster1")
.HP 2
\(bu An LSF primary administrator (owns the  configuration files and log 
files; e.g., LSF_ADMINS="lsfadmin")
.RE
.PP
Prepare your systems for installation:
.RS
.HP 2
\(bu Ensure the installation file system on the file server host has enough 
disk space for all hosts types (approximately 300 MB per host type)
.HP 2
\(bu Ensure top-level installation directory (LSF_TOP) is accessible with 
the same path name from all hosts in the LSF cluster (e.g., 
/usr/share/lsf)
.HP 2
\(bu Create UNIX user accounts for LSF administrators (e.g., lsfadmin)
.HP 2
\(bu Read the LSF 4.2 readme.html and release_notes.html files 
(on the LSF CD or in /distrib/4.2/ on the ftp.platform.com 
FTP site) for detailed steps for downloading LSF distribution tar files
.HP 2
\(bu Get the LSF installation script tar file lsf4.2_install.tar.Z and 
extract it (e.g., # zcat lsf4.2_install.tar.Z | tar xvf -)
.HP 2
\(bu Read lsf4.2_install/README for information about the contents 
of lsf4.2_install.tar.Z
.HP 2
\(bu Get the LSF distribution tar files for all host types you need, and put 
them in the same directory as lsf4.2_install.tar.Z  (e.g., for 
AIX: lsf4.2_standard_aix4.tar.Z). Do not extract the files.
.HP 2
\(bu Ensure the installation file system containing LSF_TOP is writable 
by the user account that is running \fBlsfinstall\fR

.SS Non-root installation
.BR
.PP
.PP
You can install LSF as a non-root user with some limitations. During 
installation, \fBlsfinstall\fR detects that you are not root. You must 
choose to configure either a multi-user cluster or a single-user cluster:
.RS
.HP 2
\(bu Multi-user--Any user can submit jobs to your cluster. To make the 
cluster available to other users, you must manually change the 
ownership and setuid bit for \fBlsadmin\fR and \fBbadmin\fR to root.
.HP 2
\(bu Single-user--Your user account must be primary LSF administrator. 
You will be able to start LSF daemons, but only your user account 
can submit jobs to the cluster. Your user account must be able to 
read the system kernel information, such as /dev/kmem.
