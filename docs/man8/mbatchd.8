.SH DESCRIPTION
openlava is a load sharing batch system that supports distributed batch job
processing.
There is a slave batch daemon, sbatchd, on every server host.
The slave batch daemon on the same host as the master Load Information
Manager (\s-1LIM\s0) of the underlying
\s-1openlava Base\s0 is responsible for starting a
master batch daemon,
mbatchd, on its host for the local \s-1openlava\s0 cluster.
The sbatchds are typically started at system boot time by
.BR rc.local (8).
You must never start the mbatchd daemon unless you are running
it with the \fB-C\fR option.
.PP
In order to use the openlava system, mbatchd and sbatchd must be registered in
the services database, such as \fB/etc/services\fR or the \s-1NIS\s0
services map, 
or \fBLSB_MBD_PORT\fR and \fBLSB_SBD_PORT\fR must be defined in the file
\fBlsf.conf\fR.  
The service names are `\fBmbatchd\fR' and `\fBsbatchd\fR' respectively, and
the protocol is `\fBtcp\fR' (see
.BR services (8)).
You can select any unused port numbers.
.PP
You can submit batch jobs from any host to the mbatchd.
mbatchd contacts the \s-1LIM\s0 to
obtain current load information about hosts that satisfy the resource
requirements provided at job submission (see
.BR bsub (1)).
If no suitable hosts are found, the jobs are held by
the mbatchd (that is, they are pending).
Once suitable execution hosts are found, mbatchd dispatches the jobs to
one or more sbatchds on the selected hosts for execution.
.PP
An sbatchd accepts job execution requests from the mbatchd,
starts the jobs and monitors the progress of the jobs.
Based on the execution conditions specified by the mbatchd at job dispatch
time, an sbatchd may stop and resume a job in response to changes in the host
load conditions, interactive user activities and queue or host run windows.
Such actions by an sbatchd are reported back to the mbatchd.
When a job is finished (either completed successfully or with an error, or
terminated by a user, a \s-1openlava \s0 administrator or the queue administrator),
the job output is either mailed to the user who submitted the
job, or stored in a file specified at job submission (see
.BR bsub (1)).
.PP
Besides processing user requests, mbatchd
performs most of the scheduling functions of openlava.
openlava is fault tolerant: a new mbatchd is
started if the host of the current mbatchd fails, and no jobs are lost,
except those running on the failed host.
These jobs may be rerun from begin on some other hosts or, 
if they are checkpointable, restarted from their last checkpoint
on some other hosts.
.PP
Most of the user's environment (such as the current working directory,
umask, and user groups) at the time of batch job submission is
retained and used for batch job execution.
.PP
mbatchd and sbatchd read the file \fBlsf.conf\fR (see \fB-d\fR option)
to get the environment information.
The file \fBlsf.conf\fR is a generic configuration file shared
by \s-1openlava \s0 and applications built on top of it. It contains environment
information as to where the specific configuration files and data
files are and other information that dictates the behavior of the
software. The information of interest to
openlava includes: \fBLSB_CONFDIR\fR, \fBLSB_SHAREDIR\fR, \fBLSB_LOCALDIR\fR, 
\fBLSB_MAILPROG\fR,
\fBLSB_MAILTO\fR, \fBLSF_SERVERDIR\fR, \fBLSF_LOG_MASK\fR,
\fBLSB_DEBUG\fR, \fBLSB_MBD_PORT\fR, \fBLSB_SBD_PORT\fR
and \fBLSF_LOGDIR\fR.
See \fBlsf.conf\fR(5) for details of \fBLSF_SERVERDIR\fR, \fBLSF_LOG_MASK\fR,
and \fBLSF_LOGDIR\fR.
The other parameters are explained below:
.TP 5
.B LSB_CONFDIR
The directory in which all batch configuration files are stored. The files
used by openlava are organized on a cluster basis, i.e., each cluster
has its unique set of directories. The actual files for 
the cluster <\fIclustername\fR> are stored in directory 
\fBLSB_CONFDIR\fR/<\fIclustername\fR>/\fBconfigdir\fR.
The directory \fBLSB_CONFDIR\fR should be
accessible from all openlava server hosts in the cluster.
The directory \fBLSB_CONFDIR\fR must be owned by root and accessible
by all users. The directories
\fBLSB_CONFDIR\fR/<\fIclustername\fR>
and
\fBLSB_CONFDIR\fR/<\fIclustername\fR>/\fBconfigdir\fR
must be owned by the \s-1openlava \s0 primary (first) administrator
and readable by all users.
The \s-1openlava\s0 installation procedure already does this automatically for you.
If you change the \s-1openlava\s0 administrators
after installation, you should make sure
that all the file
ownership is correct and change the section \fBClusterAdmin\fR in your \s-1openlava\s0
configuration file (see \fBlsf.cluster\fR(5)).
.TP 5
.B LSB_SHAREDIR
The directory in which the master batch daemon (mbatchd) stores job data
and accounting files. The actual files for the cluster <\fIclustername\fR> are
stored in directory 
\fBLSB_SHAREDIR\fR/<\fIclustername\fR>/\fBlogdir\fR.
The directory \fBLSB_SHAREDIR\fR should be accessible from all
openlava server hosts in the cluster. The directory
\fBLSB_SHAREDIR\fR must be owned by root and accessible
by all users. The directories
\fBLSB_SHAREDIR\fR/<\fIclustername\fR>
and
\fBLSB_SHAREDIR\fR/<\fIclustername\fR>/\fBlogdir\fR
must be owned and writable by the \s-1openlava\s0 primary (first)
administrator and accessible by all users.
.TP 5
.B LSB_LOCALDIR
The directory in which the replicated event logging process stores 
the event files.  The replicated event logging feature provides 
added fault-tolerance to mbatchd/sbatchd as it will be able to tolerate
failures of the file server where \fBLSB_SHAREDIR\fR is located.
To enable this feature \fBLSB_LOCALDIR\fR must be defined in lsf.conf.
\fBLSB_LOCALDIR\fR should be a local directory which exists ONLY 
on the first master master (i.e. first host configured
in \fBlsf.cluster\fR(5)).  Two mbatchd daemons will be started.
One of these daemons will use \fBLSB_LOCALDIR\fR to store
the primary copy of the \fBlsb.events\fR(5) files, which will 
than be replicated in the \fBLSB_SHAREDIR\fR directory.
.TP 5
.B LSB_MAILPROG
This parameter is optional. If defined, it specifies the mail transport
program. Default is \fB/usr/lib/sendmail\fR.  If this parameter is
changed, the sbatchd must be restarted so that the new value will be picked
up (see
.BR badmin (1)).
.TP 5
.B LSB_MAILTO
This parameter is optional. If defined, it specifies the mail address format.
openlava uses mails to send job output or error message to users. The possible
formats are:
.RS 10
.nf
\fB!U\fR                         (the default. Send to \fIuser\fR's account name)
\fB!U@!H\fR                  (Send to \fIuser\fB@\fIjob_submission_hostname\fR)
\fB!U@\fIcompany_name.com\fR    (Send to \fIuser\fB@\fIcompany_name.com\fR)
.fi
.RE
If this parameter is changed, the sbatchd must be restarted so that the new
value will be picked up (see
.BR badmin (1)).
.TP 5
.B LSB_CRDIR
This parameter specifies
the directory containing the \fBchkpnt/restart\fR utility programs that
the sbatchd daemon is to use to checkpoint or restart a job.
This parameter applies to platforms that have system support checkpoint/restart
by means of the \fBchkpnt/restart\fR utility programs.  Currently,
this parameter should only be defined on convex systems.
If \fBLSB_CRDIR\fR is not defined, then the default is \fB/bin\fR.
.TP 5
.B LSB_MBD_PORT/LSB_SBD_PORT
This defines the \s-1TCP\s0 port number that mbatchd/sbatchd
uses to serve all requests. If \fBLSB_MBD_PORT\fR/\fBLSB_SBD_PORT\fR 
is defined,  mbatchd/sbatchd 
will not look into system services database for port numbers. Any unused
port numbers can be specified.
.TP 5
.B LSB_DEBUG
If this is defined, openlava will run in single user mode. In this mode,
security checking are not performed and therefore openlava daemons
should not run as root. When \fBLSB_DEBUG\fR is defined, openlava will not
look into system services database for port numbers. Instead, it 
uses port number 40000 for mbatchd
and port number 40001 for  sbatchd
unless \fBLSB_MBD_PORT/LSB_SBD_PORT\fR  is defined in the file \fBlsf.conf\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 5
.B -h
Print command usage to stderr and exit.
.TP 5
.B -V
Print \s-1openlava\s0 release version to stderr and exit.
.TP 5
.B -C
This option applies to mbatchd only. If specified, mbatchd will do the syntax
checking on the openlava configuration files and prints verbose messages
to stdout. After the checking, mbatchd will exit. Mbatchd with \fB-C\fR option does
not have to be run on the master host (as returned by \fBlsid\fR(1)). You must
never start mbatchd manually unless the \fB-C\fR option is used.
.TP 5
.B -d \fIenv_dir\fR
Read \fBlsf.conf\fR file from the directory
.I env_dir,
rather than from the default directory \fB/etc\fR, or from the directory
\fBLSF_ENVDIR\fR that is set in the environment variable.
.TP 5
.BI - debug_level
Debug mode level. Possible values are either 1 or 2. When debug mode is
set, the daemons are run in debug mode and can be started by a normal user
(non-root). If debug level is 1, sbatchd will go to background
when started. If debug level is 2, sbatchd will stay in foreground.
mbatchd is always started by sbatchd with the same options, and therefore
has the same debug level. If openlava daemons are running in debug mode,
\fBLSB_DEBUG\fR must be defined in the file \fBlsf.conf\fR
in order for openlava commands to talk with the daemons.
.SH QUEUES AND LOGS
Visible to users are a number of job queues to which jobs can be submitted.
Job queues are defined by the \s-1openlava\s0 administrator in the cluster
configuration file \fBlsb.queues\fR.
See
.BR lsb.queues (5)
for a description of the queue configuration.
.PP
Two types of log files are maintained by mbatchd: event log and job log.
The files are named \fBlsb.events\fR and \fBlsb.acct\fR, respectively. See
.BR lsb.events (5)
and
.BR lsb.acct (5)
for the description. 
.SH "ERROR REPORTING"
mbatchd and sbatchd have no controlling tty. Serious errors are mailed to the
\s-1openlava\s0 administrator. Less serious errors are sent to syslog with
log level \fBLOG_ERR\fR, or written to the file
\fBLSF_LOGDIR/mbatchd.log.\fR<\fIhostname\fR> or
\fBLSF_LOGDIR/sbatchd.log.\fR<\fIhostname\fR>,
if \fBLSF_LOGDIR\fR is defined in the file \fBlsf.conf\fR.
