.SH NAME
pim \- Process Information Manager (\s-1PIM\s0) for the Load Sharing Facility
(\s-1LSF\s0) system
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBLSF_SERVDIR/pim [ -h ] [ -V ] [ -d \fIenv_dir\fB ] [ -\fIdebug_level\fB ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\s-1PIM\s0 is a daemon started by the
.BR LIM (8)
on every server host which is participating in load sharing.
The \s-1PIM\s0 collects resource usage of the processes running on the
local host.  The information collected by the \s-1PIM\s0 is used
by other parts of LSF (e.g.,
.BR sbatchd (8))
to monitor resource consumption and enforce usage limits.
.PP
The \s-1PIM\s0 updates the process information every 15 minutes
unless an application queries this information.  If an application
requests the information, the \s-1PIM\s0 will update
the process information every \fBLSF_PIM_SLEEPTIME\fR seconds, where
\fBLSF_PIM_SLEEPTIME\fR can be defined in the
.BR lsf.conf (5)
file.
The default value for \fBLSF_PIM_SLEEPTIME\fR is 15 seconds, if this
parameter is not defined.  If the information
is not queried by any application for more than 5 minutes, the \s-1PIM\s0
will revert back to the 15 minute update period.
.PP
The process information is stored in
\fBLSF_PIM_INFODIR/pim.info.<hostname>\fR
where \fBLSF_PIM_INFODIR\fR can be defined in the \fBlsf.conf\fR file.
If this parameter is not defined, the default directory is \fB/tmp\fR.
The \s-1PIM\s0 also reads this file when it starts up so that it can
accumulate the resource usage of dead processes for existing process
groups.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 5
.B -h
Print command usage to stderr and exit.
.TP 5
.B -V
Print \s-1LSF\s0 release version to stderr and exit.
.TP 5
.B -d \fIenv_dir\fR
Read \fBlsf.conf\fR from the directory
.I env_dir,
rather than the default directory \fB/etc\fR, or the directory specified by
the \fBLSF_ENVDIR\fR environment variable.
.TP 5
.BI - debug_level
Set the debug level. Valid values are 1 and 2. If specified, \s-1PIM\s0
runs in debugging mode.
If \fIdebug_level\fR is 1, \s-1PIM\s0
runs in the background, with no associated control terminal.
If \fIdebug_level\fR
is 2, \s-1PIM\s0 runs in the foreground, printing error messages on to
tty. The \fIdebug_level\fR option overrides the environment variable
\fBLSF_LIM_DEBUG\fR defined in
.BR lsf.conf (5).
.SH NOTE
\s-1PIM\s0 needs read access to \fB/dev/kmem\fR or its equivalent.
.SH FILES
.PD 0
.TP
\fB/etc/lsf.conf\fR (by default) or \fBLSF_ENVDIR/lsf.conf\fR
