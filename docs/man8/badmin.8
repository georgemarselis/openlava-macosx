.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR
.PP
.PP
This command can only be used by openlava administrators.
.PP
badmin provides a set of commands to control and monitor openlava. If no 
subcommands are supplied for badmin, badmin prompts for a 
command from standard input. Commands bqc(8), breconfig(8) and 
breboot(8) are superceded by badmin(8).
.PP
Information about each command is available through the help 
command.
.PP
The badmin commands consist of a set of privileged commands and a 
set of non\fB-\fRprivileged commands. Privileged commands can only be 
invoked by root or openlava administrators as defined in the configuration 
file (see lsf.cluster.cluster(5) for ClusterAdmin). Privileged 
commands are:
.PP
reconfig
.PP
mbdrestart
.PP
qopen
.PP
qclose
.PP
qact
.PP
qinact
.PP
hopen
.PP
hclose
.PP
hrestart
.PP
hshutdown
.PP
hstartup
.PP
All other commands are non\fB-\fRprivileged commands and can be invoked 
by any openlava user. If the privileged commands are to be executed by an 
openlava administrator, badmin must be installed setuid root, because it 
needs to send the request using a privileged port.
.PP
For subcommands for which multiple host names or host groups can 
be specified, do not enclose the multiple names in quotation marks. 
.SH OPTIONS
.BR
.PP
.TP 
\fIsubcommand
\fR
.IP
Executes the specified subcommand. See Usage section.


.TP 
\fB-h
\fR
.IP
Prints command usage to stderr and exits.


.TP 
\fB-V
\fR
.IP
Prints openlava release version to stderr and exits.


.SH USAGE
.BR
.PP
.TP 
\fBckconfig\fR [\fB-v\fR]

.IP
Checks openlava configuration files. Configuration files are located in the 
LSB_CONFDIR/\fIcluster_name\fR/configdir directory. 

.IP
The LSB_CONFDIR variable is defined in lsf.conf (see lsf.conf(5)) 
which is in LSF_ENVDIR or /etc (if LSF_ENVDIR is not defined).

.IP
By default, badmin ckconfig displays only the result of the 
configuration file check. If warning errors are found, badmin prompts 
you to display detailed messages.


.IP
\fB-v\fR
.BR
.RS
.IP
Verbose mode. Displays detailed messages about configuration 
file checking to stderr.

.RE

.TP 
\fBreconfig\fR [\fB-v\fR] [\fB-f\fR]

.IP
Dynamically reconfigures openlava without restarting MBD. Configuration 
files are checked for errors and the results displayed to stderr. If no 
errors are found in the configuration files, a reconfiguration request is 
sent to MBD and configuration files are reloaded.

.IP
With this command, MBD is not restarted and lsb.events is not 
replayed. To restart MBD and replay lsb.events, use badmin 
mbdrestart.

.IP
When you issue this command, MBD is available to service requests 
while reconfiguration files are reloaded. Configuration changes made 
since system boot or the last reconfiguration take effect.

.IP
If warning errors are found, badmin prompts you to display detailed 
messages. If fatal errors are found, reconfiguration is not performed, 
and badmin exits.

.IP
If you add a host to a host group, or a host to a queue, the new host 
will not be recognized by jobs that were submitted before you 
reconfigured. If you want the new host to be recognized, you must use 
the command badmin mbdrestart.


.IP
\fB-v\fR
.BR
.RS
.IP
Verbose mode. Displays detailed messages about the status of 
the configuration files. Without this option, the default is to 
display the results of configuration file checking. All messages 
from the configuration file check are printed to stderr.

.RE

.IP
\fB-f\fR
.BR
.RS
.IP
Disables interaction and proceeds with reconfiguration if 
configuration files contain no fatal errors.

.RE

.TP 
\fBmbdrestart\fR [\fB-v\fR] [\fB-f\fR]

.IP
Dynamically reconfigures openlava and restarts MBD. Configuration files are 
checked for errors and the results printed to stderr. If no errors are 
found, configuration files are reloaded, MBD is restarted, and events in 
lsb.events are replayed to recover the running state of the last MBD. 
MBD is unavailable to service requests while it restarts.

.IP
If warning errors are found, badmin prompts you to display detailed 
messages. If fatal errors are found, MBD restart is not performed, and 
badmin exits.

.IP
If lsb.events is large, or many jobs are running, restarting MBD can 
take several minutes. If you only need to reload the configuration files, 
use badmin reconfig.


.IP
\fB-v\fR 
.BR
.RS
.IP
Verbose mode. Displays detailed messages about the status of 
configuration files. All messages from configuration checking 
are printed to stderr.

.RE

.IP
\fB-f\fR
.BR
.RS
.IP
Disables interaction and forces reconfiguration and MBD restart 
to proceed if configuration files contain no fatal errors.

.RE

.TP 
\fBqopen\fR [\fIqueue_name ... \fR| \fBall\fR]

.IP
Opens specified queues, or all queues if the reserved word all is 
specified. If no queue is specified, the system default queue is assumed 
(see lsb.queues(5) for DEFAULT_QUEUE). A queue can accept batch 
jobs only if it is open.


.TP 
\fBqclose\fR [\fIqueue_name\fR ... | \fBall\fR]

.IP
Closes specified queues, or all queues if the reserved word all is 
specified. If no queue is specified, the system default queue is 
assumed. A queue will not accept any job if it is closed.


.TP 
\fBqact \fR[\fIqueue_name\fR ... | \fBall\fR]

.IP
Activates specified queues, or all queues if the reserved word all is 
specified. If no queue is specified, the system default queue is 
assumed. Jobs in a queue can be dispatched if the queue is activated. 

.IP
A queue inactivated by its run windows cannot be reactivated by this 
command (see lsb.queues(5) for RUN_WINDOW).


.TP 
\fBqinact\fR [\fIqueue_name\fR ... | \fBall\fR]

.IP
Inactivates specified queues, or all queues if the reserved word all is 
specified. If no queue is specified, the system default queue is 
assumed. No job in a queue can be dispatched if the queue is 
inactivated.


.TP 
\fBqhist\fR [\fB-t\fR \fItime0\fR,\fItime1\fR] [\fB-f\fR \fIlogfile_name\fR] [\fIqueue_name\fR ...]

.IP
Displays historical events for specified queues, or for all queues if no 
queue is specified. Queue events are queue opening, closing, 
activating and inactivating.


.IP
\fB-t\fR \fItime0\fR,\fItime1\fR
.BR
.RS
.IP
Displays only those events that occurred during the period 
from \fItime0\fR to \fItime1\fR. See bhist(1) for the time format. The 
default is to display all queue events in the event log file (see 
below).

.RE

.IP
\fB-f\fR \fIlogfile_name\fR
.BR
.RS
.IP
Specify the file name of the event log file. Either an absolute or 
a relative path name may be specified. The default is to use the 
event log file currently used by the openlava system: 
LSB_SHAREDIR/cluster_name/logdir/lsb.events. Option 
-f is useful for offline analysis.

.RE

.TP 
\fBhopen\fR [\fIhost_name \fR... | \fIhost_group \fR... | \fBall\fR]

.IP
Opens batch server hosts. Specify the names of any server hosts or host 
groups (see bmgroup(1)). All batch server hosts will be opened if the 
reserved word all is specified. If no host or host group is specified, 
the local host is assumed. A host accepts batch jobs if it is open.


.TP 
\fBhclose\fR [\fIhost_name \fR... | \fIhost_group \fR... | \fBall\fR]

.IP
Closes batch server hosts. Specify the names of any server hosts or host 
groups (see bmgroup(1)). All batch server hosts will be closed if the 
reserved word all is specified. If no argument is specified, the local 
host is assumed. A closed host will not accept any new job, but jobs 
already dispatched to the host will not be affected. Note that this is 
different from a host closed by a window \fB-\fR all jobs on it are suspended 
in that case.


.TP 
\fBhrestart\fR [\fB-f\fR] [\fIhost_name \fR... | \fBall\fR]

.IP
Restarts SBD on the specified hosts, or on all server hosts if the 
reserved word all is specified. If no host is specified, the local host is 
assumed. SBD will re\fB-\fRexecute itself from the beginning. This allows 
new SBD binaries to be used.


.IP
\fB-f\fR
.BR
.RS
.IP
Disables interaction and does not ask for confirmation for 
restarting SBDs. 

.RE

.TP 
\fBhshutdown\fR [\fB-f\fR] [\fIhost_name \fR... | \fBall\fR]

.IP
Shuts down SBD on the specified hosts, or on all batch server hosts if 
the reserved word all is specified. If no host is specified, the local host 
is assumed. SBD will exit upon receiving the request.


.IP
\fB-f\fR
.BR
.RS
.IP
Disables interaction and does not ask for confirmation for 
shutting down SBDs. 

.RE

.TP 
\fBhstartup\fR [\fB-f\fR] [\fIhost_name \fR... | \fBall\fR]

.IP
Starts up SBD on the specified hosts, or on all batch server hosts if the 
reserved word all is specified. Only root 
can use this option, and those users must be able to 
use rsh on all openlava hosts. If no host is specified, the local host is 
assumed.


.IP
\fB-f\fR
.BR
.RS
