.SH DESCRIPTION 
.BR
.PP
.PP
echkpnt is the interface through which jobs are checkpointed. 
.PP
By default, jobs continue to execute after they have been checkpointed. 
.PP
Some options in the synopsis are only supported by some operating systems. 
.SS echkpnt 
.BR
.PP

.IP
echkpnt is located in LSF_SERVERDIR. 

.IP
echkpnt sends checkpoint instructions provided through job submission 
or through queue parameters to LSF's checkpoint facility 
echkpnt.default or to any custom echkpnt methods that you define. 
Communication is achieved through the common syntax indicated in the 
synopsis. 


.SS echkpnt.default 
.BR
.PP

.IP
echkpnt.default is located in LSF_SERVERDIR. 

.IP
By default, when a job is checkpointed, echkpnt.default is used. 
echkpnt.default uses the arguments \fIcheckpoint_dir\fR and 
process_group_ID to identify where checkpoint files are to be created 
and which job is to be checkpointed. echkpnt.default then creates 
checkpoint files in\fI \fR\fIcheckpoint_dir\fR/\fIjob_ID\fR and attempts to checkpoint 
the job. 


.SS echkpnt.method_name 
.BR
.PP

.IP
echkpnt.\fImethod_name\fR is a custom echkpnt that attempts to run a custom 
checkpoint program or script. 

.IP
The name of the custom echkpnt method must be 
echkpnt.\fImethod_name\fR, where \fImethod_name\fR is a name you assign to 
your custom echkpnt. The method_name must be specified either with 
LSB_ECHKPNT_METHOD (in lsf.conf, as an environment variable) 
and/or when the job is submitted with the bsub -k option such as bsub -
k "mydir 120 method=myapp" job1. 

.IP
echkpnt.\fImethod_name\fR must support the syntax described in the 
synopsis. 

.IP
echkpnt.\fImethod_name\fR is placed in LSF_SERVERDIR, or in the directory 
specified by LSB_ECHKPNT_METHOD_DIR (set in lsf.conf or as an 
environment variable). 

.IP
The method name (LSB_ECHKPNT_METHOD in lsf.conf or as an 
environment variable) and location (LSB_ECHKPNT_METHOD_DIR) 
combination must be unique in the cluster. For example, you may have 
two echkpnt applications with the same name such as 
echkpnt.mymethod but what differentiates them is the different directories 
defined with LSB_ECHKPNT_METHOD_DIR. 

.IP
The checkpoint method directory should be accessible by all users who 
need to run the custom echkpnt and erestart programs.

.IP
Do not use default as a method name as this is a reserved keyword to 
indicate to use LSF's default echkpnt and erestart methods. 

.IP
If you want to specify to use LSF's echkpnt.default for a specific 
application, specify method=default at job submission with bsub -k. 


.SH OPTIONS 
.BR
.PP
.TP 
\fB-c\fR 

.IP
This option is supported on only some operating systems such as Convex. 

.IP
Copies to the checkpoint directory all files in use by the checkpointed process. 


.TP 
\fB-f\fR 

.IP
This option is supported on only some operating systems such as Convex. 

.IP
Forces a job to be checkpointed even if non-checkpointable conditions exist 
(these conditions are specific to the type of checkpoint facility being used). 
This option may create checkpoint files that will not restart properly. 


.TP 
\fB-k\fR | \fB-s\fR 

.IP
Options -k and -s are mutually exclusive. 


.RE
.IP
\fB-k\fR 
.BR
.RS

.IP
Kills a job after it has been successfully checkpointed. If this option is 
specified and the checkpoint fails for any reason, the job continues to 
execute. 



.RE
.IP
\fB-s\fR 
.BR
.RS

.IP
This option is supported on only some operating systems such as SGI 
systems running IRIX, and Convex. 

.IP
Stops a job after it has been successfully checkpointed. If this option is 
specified and the checkpoint fails for any reason, the job continues to 
execute. 



.TP 
\fB-d\fR \fIcheckpoint_dir\fR 

.IP
Specifies the checkpoint directory. Specify a relative or absolute path name. 

.IP
When a job is checkpointed, the checkpoint information is stored in 
\fIcheckpoint_dir\fR/\fIjob_ID\fR/\fIfile_name\fR. Multiple jobs can checkpoint into the 
same directory. The system can create multiple files. 

.IP
The checkpoint directory is used for restarting the job (see brestart(1)).


.TP 
\fB-x\fR 

.IP
This option is supported on only some operating systems such as SGI systems 
running IRIX. 

.IP
Identifies the cpr process as type HID (process hierarchy rooted at that PID). 


.TP 
\fIprocess_group_ID\fR 

.IP
ID of the process or process group to be checkpointed. 


.TP 
\fB-h\fR 

.IP
Prints command usage to stderr and exits. 


.TP 
\fB-V\fR 

.IP
Prints LSF release version to stderr and exits.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS 
.BR
.PP
.SS echkpnt 
.BR
.PP

.IP
Exits with a 0 if the checkpoint operation succeeds. Otherwise, exits with 
the value of echkpnt.default or echkpnt.\fImethod_name\fR. 


.SS echkpnt.default 
.BR
.PP

.IP
If LSF's default checkpoint program echkpnt.default is used and the job 
is successfully checkpointed, echkpnt.default exits with a 0 and writes 
nothing to stdout and stderr or the message "Done" or "Success". 
echkpnt.default returns non-zero values if the checkpoint operation 
fails. In addition, all messages in stdout or stderr that are returned by 
echkpnt.default are interpreted by LSF as failure of the checkpoint 
operation. 


.SS echkpnt.method_name 
.BR
.PP

.IP
If a custom checkpoint program is used (LSB_ECHKPNT_METHOD is 
defined in lsf.conf or as an environment variable, or the checkpoint 
method specified such as bsub -k "mydir method=myapp" job1), 
echkpnt.\fImethod_name\fR exits with a 0 if it succeeds in checkpointing the 
job. Non-zero values indicate job checkpoint failed. All messages written 
to stdout and stderr are directed to /dev/null and ignored by LSF. 

.IP
To save standard error and standard out messages for echkpnt. 
\fImethod_name\fR, set LSB_ECHKPNT_KEEP_OUTPUT=y in lsf.conf or as 
an environment variable. The stdout and stderr output generated by 
echkpnt. \fImethod_name\fR will be redirected to: 

.IP
- \fIcheckpoint_dir\fR/$LSB_JOBID/echkpnt.out 

.IP
- \fIcheckpoint_dir\fR/$LSB_JOBID/echkpnt.err 


.SH LIMITATIONS 
.BR
.PP
.PP
If you define LSF_ECHKPNTDIR, you cannot use a custom echkpnt method. It 
is recommended to no longer use LSF_ECHKPNTDIR but use instead 
LSB_ECHKPNT_METHOD and LSB_ECHKPNT_METHOD_DIR. 
.PP
If you use echkpnt.\fImethod_name\fR, once the job has been submitted, the job 
will be checkpointed with the method that was specified at job submission or 
with the parameter LSB_ECHKPNT_METHOD. You cannot change the method 
with the bmod command. 
.PP
If you submit a job and do not specify a custom method, and 
LSB_ECHKPNT_METHOD is not defined, echkpnt.default will be used. You 
will not be able to change this with bmod. 
.PP
It is the cluster administrator's responsibility to ensure that method name and 
method directory combinations are unique in the cluster.
