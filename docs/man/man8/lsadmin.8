.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR
.PP
.PP
This command can only be used by LSF administrators. 
.PP
lsadmin is a tool that executes privileged commands to control LIM 
and RES operations in an LSF cluster. 
.PP
If no subcommands are supplied for lsadmin, lsadmin prompts for 
subcommands from the standard input.

.IP
For subcommands for which multiple host names or host groups can 
be specified, do not enclose the multiple names in quotation marks. 


.SH OPTIONS
.BR
.PP
.TP 
\fIsubcommand
\fR
.IP
Executes the specified subcommand. See Usage section. 


.TP 
\fB-h\fR 

.IP

.TP 
\fBreconfig \fR[\fB-f\fR] [\fB-v\fR]

.IP
Restarts LIMs on all hosts in the cluster. You should use reconfig after 
changing configuration files. The configuration files are checked before 
all LIMs in the cluster are restarted. If the configuration files are not 
correct, reconfiguration will not be initiated.


.IP
\fB-f \fR
.BR
.RS
.IP
Disables user interaction and forces LIM to restart on all hosts 
in the cluster if no fatal errors are found. This option is useful 
in batch mode.

\fBlimrestart\fR [\fB-v\fR] [\fB-f\fR] [\fIhost_name \fR... | \fBall\fR]

.IP
Restarts LIM on the local host if no arguments are supplied.

.IP
Restarts LIMs on the specified hosts or on all hosts in the cluster if the 
word all is specified. You will be asked for confirmation.

.IP
limrestart should be used with care. Do not make any modifications 
until all the LIMs have completed the startup process. If you execute 
limrestart \fIhost_name\fR\fI...\fR to restart some of the LIMs after changing 
the configuration files, but other LIMs are still running the old 
configuration, confusion will arise among these LIMs. To avoid this 
situation, use reconfig instead of limrestart.

job will be sent to a locked host by LSF.


.IP

.IP
Logs tasks executed by RESs on the specified hosts or on all hosts in 
the cluster if all is specified.

RES will write the task's resource usage information into the log file 
lsf.acct.\fIhost_name\fR. The location of the log file is determined by 
LSF_RES_ACCTDIR defined in lsf.conf. If LSF_RES_ACCTDIR is not

instead.
