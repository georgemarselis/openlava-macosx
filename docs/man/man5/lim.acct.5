.SH NAME
\fBlim.acct\fR - Log file of the LIM.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR
.PP
.PP
A log file produced by lsmon, lim.acct contains host load information  
collected and distributed by Load Information Manager (LIM). The first 
line contains a list of load index names separated by spaces. This list 
of load index names can be specified in the lsmon command line. The 
default list is "\fBr15s r1m r15m ut pg ls it swp mem tmp\fR". Subsequent 
lines in the file contain the host's load information at the time the 
information was recorded. 
.SH Fields
.BR
.PP
.PP
Fields are ordered in the following sequence: 
.TP 
\fItime (%ld)\fR 

.IP
The time when the load information is written to the log file 


.TP 
\fIhost name (%s)\fR 

.IP
The name of the host.


.TP 
\fIstatus of host (%d)\fR 

.IP
An array of integers. The first integer marks the operation status of the 
host. Additional integers are used as a bit map to indicate load status 
of the host. An integer can be used for 32 load indices. If the number 
of user defined load indices is not more than 21, only one integer is 
used for both built-in load indices and external load indices. See the 
\fBhostload\fR structure in ls_load(3) for the description of these fields.


.TP 
\fIindexvalue (%f)\fR 

.IP
A sequence of load index values. Each value corresponds to the index 
name in the first line of lim.acct. The order in which the index values 
are listed is the same as the order of the index names.
