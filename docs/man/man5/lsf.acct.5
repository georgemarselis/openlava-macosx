.SH NAME
\fBlsf.acct\fR - openlava task log file 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR
.PP
.PP
The openlava Remote Execution Server, RES (see \fBres\fR(8)), generates a record 
for each task completion or failure. If the RES task logging is turned on 
(see lsadmin(8)), it appends the record to the task log file 
lsf.acct.<\fIhostname\fR>. 
.PP
The task log file is an ASCII file with one task record per line. The fields 
of each record are separated by blanks. The location of the file is 
determined by the \fBLSF_RES_ACCTDIR\fR variable defined in the lsf.conf 
file (see lsf.conf(5)). If this variable is not defined, or the RES cannot 
access the log directory, the log file is created in \fB/tmp\fR instead. 
.SH Fields

.TP 
exitStatus (%d)

.IP

.TP 
dispTime (%ld)
