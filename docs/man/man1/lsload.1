.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR
.PP
.PP
\fB\fRDisplays load information for hosts. Load information can be displayed 
on a per-host basis, or on a per-resource basis.
.PP
By default, displays load information for all hosts in the local cluster, 
per host. 
.PP
By default, displays raw load indices.
.PP
By default, load information for resources is displayed according to CPU 
and paging load.
.SH OPTIONS
.BR
.PP
.TP 
\fB-l
\fR
.IP
Long format. Displays load information without truncation along with 
additional fields for I/O and external load indices.

.IP


.IP
This option overrides the index names specified with the -I option.


.TP 
\fB-N
\fR
.IP
Displays normalized CPU run queue length load indices (see 
lsfintro(1)).


.TP 
\fB-E
\fR
.IP
Displays effective CPU run queue length load indices (see 
lsfintro(1)). Options -N and -E are mutually exclusive.


.TP 
\fB-I\fR \fIload_index\fR[\fB:\fR\fIload_index\fR] ...

.IP
Displays only load information for the specified load indices. Load 
index names must be separated by a colon (for example, r1m:pg:ut).


.TP 
\fB-n\fR\fI \fR\fInum_hosts
\fR
.IP
Displays only load information for the requested number of hosts. 
Information for up to \fInum_hosts\fR hosts that best satisfy the resource 
requirements is displayed.


.TP 
\fB-R\fR\fI \fR\fIres_req
\fR
.IP
Displays only load information for hosts that satisfy the specified 
resource requirements. See lsinfo(1) for a list of built-in resource 
names.

.IP
Load information for the hosts is sorted according to load on the 
specified resources.

.IP
If \fIres_req\fR contains special resource names, only load information for 
hosts that provide these resources is displayed (see lshosts(1) to find 
out what resources are available on each host).

.IP
If one or more host names are specified, only load information about 
the hosts that satisfy the resource requirements is displayed.


.TP 
\fIhost_name\fR ... 

.IP
Displays only load information for the specified hosts. 


.TP 
-s [\fIresource_name\fR ...]

.IP
Displays information for all dynamic shared resources configured in the 
cluster.

.IP
If resources are specified, only displays information for the specified 
resources. \fIresource_name\fR must be a dynamic shared resource name.

.IP



.TP 
\fB-h
\fR
.IP
Prints command usage to stderr and exits.


.TP 
\fB-V
\fR
.IP
Prints openlava release version to stderr and exits.


.SH OUTPUT
.BR
.PP
.SS HOST-BASED OUTPUT (Default output)
.BR
.PP
.PP
Numeric dynamic non-shared resources are displayed. The selection 
and order sections of \fIres_req\fR control for which hosts information is 
displayed and how they are ordered (see lsfintro(1)).
.PP
The displayed default load information includes the following fields:

.IP
HOST_NAME
.BR
.RS
.IP
Standard host name used by openlava, typically an Internet domain name 
with two components.

.RE

.IP
status
.BR
.RS
.IP
Status of the host. A minus sign (-) may precede the status, 
indicating that the Remote Execution Server (RES) on the host is not 
running.

.IP
Possible statuses are:


.IP
ok
.BR
.RS
.IP
The host is in normal load sharing state and can accept remote 
jobs.

.RE

.IP
busy
.BR
.RS
.IP
The host is overloaded because some load indices exceed 
configured thresholds. Load index values that caused the host 
to be busy are preceded by an asterisk (*). Built-in load indices 
include r15s, r1m, r15m, ut, pg, io, ls, it, swp, mem and tmp 
(see below). External load indices are configured in the file 
lsf.cluster.\fIcluster_name\fR (see lsf.cluster(5)).


.IP
r15s
.BR
.RS
.IP
The 15-second exponentially averaged CPU run queue 
length.

.RE

.IP
r1m
.BR
.RS
.IP
The 1-minute exponentially averaged CPU run queue 
length.

.RE

.IP
r15m
.BR
.RS
.IP
The 15-minute exponentially averaged CPU run queue 
length.

.RE

.IP
ut
.BR
.RS
.IP
The CPU utilization exponentially averaged over the last 
minute, between 0 and 1.

.RE

.IP
pg
.BR
.RS
.IP
The memory paging rate exponentially averaged over the 
last minute, in pages per second.

.RE

.IP
io
.BR
.RS
.IP
The disk I/O rate exponentially averaged over the last 
minute, in KB per second (this is only available when the -l 
option is specified).

.RE

.IP
ls
.BR
.RS
.IP
The number of current login users.

.RE

.IP
it

.IP
external_index
.BR
.RS
.IP
Any site-configured global external load indices (see

option with the index name is used, and only if defined in 
the lsf.cluster.\fIcluster_name\fR (see lsf.cluster(5)) 
configuration file. Note that \fIexternal_index\fR should not 
contain shared resources.

.RE
.RE

.IP
lockW
.BR
.RS
.IP
The host is locked by its run window. Run windows for a host 
are specified in the configuration file (see lsf.conf(5)) and 
can be displayed by lshosts. A locked host will not accept 
load shared jobs from other hosts.

.RE

.IP
lockU
.BR
.RS
.IP
The host is locked by the openlava administrator or root.

.RE

.IP
unavail
.BR

host is not running.

.RE
.RE
.RE
.SS RESOURCE-BASED OUTPUT (lsload -s )
.BR
.PP
.PP
Displays information about dynamic shared resources. Each line gives 
the value and the associated hosts for an instance of the resource. See 
lim(8), and lsf.cluster(5) for information on configuring 
dynamic shared resources.
.PP
The displayed information consists of the following fields:

.IP
RESOURCE
.BR
.RS
.IP
Name of the resource.

.RE

.IP
VALUE
.BR

Displays the load of all hosts, ordered by r15s:pg\fB,\fR with the CPU run 
queue lengths being the effective run queue lengths (see
