.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR
.PP
.PP
\fB\fRYou can only use brequeue on a job you own, unless you are root or 
an openlava administrator.
.PP
Kills a running (RUN), user-suspended (USUSP), or system-suspended 
(SSUSP) job and returns it to its original queue, with the same job ID. 
A job that is killed and requeued retains its submit time but is 
dispatched according to its requeue time. When the job is requeued, it 
is assigned the PEND status or PSUSP if the -H option is used. Once 
dispatched, the job starts over from the beginning. 
.PP
Use brequeue to requeue job arrays or elements of them.
.PP
By default, kills and requeues your most recently submitted job when 
no job_ID is specified.
