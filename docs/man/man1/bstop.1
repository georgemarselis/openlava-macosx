.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR
.PP
.PP
\fB\fRSuspends unfinished jobs. 
.PP
Sends the SIGSTOP signal to sequential jobs and the SIGTSTP signal to 
parallel jobs to suspend them. 
.PP
By default, suspends only one job, your most recently submitted job.
.PP
Only root and openlava administrators can operate on jobs submitted by 
other users. 
.PP
Using bstop on a job that is in the USUSP state has no effect. 
.PP
You can also use bkill -s to send the suspend signal to a job, or send 
a resume signal to a job. You can use bresume to resume suspended 
jobs. You cannot suspend a  job  that  is  already  suspended.
.PP
If a signal request fails to reach the job execution host, openlava will retry 
the operation later when the host becomes reachable. openlava retries the 
most recent signal request.
