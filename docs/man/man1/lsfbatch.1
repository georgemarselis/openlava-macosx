.SH NAME
lsfbatch \- \s-1openlava\s0 Batch system
.SH DESCRIPTION
\s-1openlava\s0 Batch is a load sharing batch system that uses \s-1LSF\s0 Base 
and \s-1LSLIB\s0 to provide distributed batch job scheduling services.
It is supported by master and slave batch daemons that run on hosts
that act as servers of distributed batch jobs (see
.BR mbatchd (8)).
The Batch commands (each with its own man page) are as follows:
.TP 15
.BR bsub (1)
submit a job for batched execution.
.TP 15
.BR bmod (1)
modify the parameters of a submitted job.
.TP 15
.BR bjobs (1)

.TP 15
.BR bqueues (1)

.TP 15
.BR bhosts (1)

.TP 15
.BR busers (1)

.TP 15

.TP 15
.BR bparams (1)
display the information about the configurable system parameters of Batch.
.TP 15
.BR bpeek (1)

.TP 15
.BR bhist (1)

.TP 15
.BR bresume (1)

.TP 15
.BR bchkpnt (1)

.TP 15
.BR brestart (1)

.TP 15
.BR bmig (1)

.TP 15
.BR bswitch (1)

.TP 15
.BR btop (1)

.TP 15
.BR bbot (1)
move a pending job to the bottom (end) of its queue.
.TP 15
.BR bacct (1)
generate accounting information about batch jobs.
.TP 15
.BR brun (1)

.\"provide a set of sub-commands for \s-1openlava\s0 administrator to control the
.\"Batch system.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
Like other load sharing utilities, Batch needs access to the
.BR lsf.conf (5)
file to get information about the system configuration. By
default, all commands look to \fB/etc\fR to find
.BR lsf.conf (5),
unless the environment variable \fBLSF_ENVDIR\fR is defined. In this case
commands look to the \fBLSF_ENVDIR\fR directory to find
.BR lsf.conf (5).
It is required that all Batch
commands use the same \fBlsf.conf\fR file as the openlava daemons.
