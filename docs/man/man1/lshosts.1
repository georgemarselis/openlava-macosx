.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR
.PP
.PP
\fB\fRDisplays static resource information about hosts. 
.PP
By default, returns the following information: host name, host type, 
host model, CPU factor, number of CPUs, total memory, total swap 
space, whether or not the host is a server host, and static resources. 
Displays information about all hosts in thecluster . See 
lsf.cluster(5). 
.PP
The -s option displays information about the static shared resources 
and their associated hosts. 
.SH OPTIONS
.BR
.PP
.TP 
\fB-w\fR 

.IP
Displays host information in wide format. Fields are displayed without 
truncation. 


.TP 
\fB-l
\fR
.IP
Displays host information in a long multi-line format. In addition to the 
default fields, displays information about the maximum /tmp space, 
the number of local disks, the execution priority for remote jobs, load 
thresholds, and run windows. 


.TP 
\fB-R\fR \fB"\fR\fIres_req\fR\fB"\fR 

.IP
Only displays information about the hosts that satisfy the resource 
requirement expression. For more information about resource 
requirements, see lsfintro(1). The size of the resource requirement 
string is limited to 512 bytes.

.IP
openlava supports ordering of resource requirements on all load indices, 
including external load indices, either static or dynamic.


.TP 
\fIhost_name\fR......

.IP
Only displays information about the specified hosts. Do not use quotes 
when specifying multiple hosts.


.TP 
\fB-s\fR\fI \fR[\fIshared_resource_name \fR...]

.IP
Displays information about the specified resources. The resources must 
be static shared resources. Returns the following information: the 
resource names, the values of the resources, and the resource 
locations. If no shared resource is specified, then displays information 
about all shared resources. 


.TP 
\fB-h\fR 

.IP
Prints command usage to stderr and exits. 


.TP 
\fB-V\fR 

.IP
Prints the openlava release version to stderr and exits. 


.SH OUTPUT
.BR
.PP
.SS Host-Based Default
.BR
.PP

.IP
Displays the following fields:


.IP
HOST_NAME
.BR
.RS
.IP
The name of the host. The host name is truncated if too long.

.RE

.IP
type
.BR
.RS
.IP
The host type. The host type is truncated if too long.

.RE

.IP
model
.BR
.RS
.IP
The host model. The host model is truncated if too long.

.RE

.IP
cpuf
.BR
.RS
.IP
The CPU factor. The CPU factor is used to scale the CPU load value 
so that differences in CPU speeds are considered. The faster the 
CPU, the larger the CPU factor. 

.IP
The CPU factor of a host with an unknown host type is 2.0. 

.RE

.IP
ncpus
.BR
.RS
.IP
The number of CPUs.

.RE

.IP
maxmem
.BR
.RS
.IP
The total memory.

.RE

.IP
maxswp
.BR
.RS
.IP
The total swap space.

.RE

.IP
server
.BR
.RS
.IP
"Yes" if the host is a server host.

.RE

.IP
RESOURCES
.BR
.RS
.IP
The available Boolean resources denoted by resource names, and 
the values of external numeric and string static resources. See 
lsf.cluster(5), and lsf.shared(5) on how to configure 
external static resources.

.RE

.SS Host Based \fB-\fRl Option
.BR
.PP
.PP
In addition to the above fields, the -l option also displays the 
following:

.IP
ndisks
.BR
.RS
.IP
The number of local disks.

.RE

.IP
maxtmp
.BR
.RS
.IP
The maximum /tmp space in megabytes configured on a host.

.RE

.IP
rexpri
.BR
.RS
.IP
The remote execution priority.

.RE

.IP
RUN_WINDOWS
.BR
.RS
.IP
The time periods during which the host is open for sharing loads 
from other hosts. (See lsf.cluster(5).)

.RE

.IP
LOAD_THRESHOLDS
.BR
.RS
.IP
The thresholds for scheduling interactive jobs. If a load threshold 
is exceeded, the host status is changed to "busy." See lsload(1).

.RE
.SS Resource-Based \fB-\fRs Option 
.BR
.PP
.PP
Displays the static shared resources. Each line gives the value and the 
associated hosts for the static shared resource. See lsf.shared(5), and 
lsf.cluster(5) on how to configure static shared resources. 
.PP
The following fields are displayed: 

.IP
RESOURCE 
.BR
.RS
.IP
The name of the resource. 

.RE

.IP
VALUE 
.BR
.RS
.IP
The value of the static shared resource.

.RE

.IP
LOCATION 
.BR
.RS
.IP
The hosts that are associated with the static shared resource.
