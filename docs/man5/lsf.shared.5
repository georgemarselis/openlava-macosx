.SS \fB\fROverview
.BR
.PP
.PP
The lsf.shared file contains common definitions that are shared by 
all load sharing clusters defined by lsf.cluster.\fIcluster_name\fR files. 
This includes lists of cluster names, host types, host models, the special 
resources available, and external load indices.

.SH Cluster Section
.BR
.PP
.PP
(Required) Lists the cluster names recognized by the openlava system
.SH Cluster Section Structure
.BR
.PP
.PP
The first line must contain the mandatory keyword ClusterName. The 
other keyword is optional.
.PP
Each subsequent line defines one cluster.
.SH ClusterName 
.BR
.PP
.SS Description
.BR
.PP
.PP
(Required) Defines all cluster names recognized by the openlava system 
.PP
All cluster names referenced anywhere in the openlava system must be 
defined here. The file names of cluster-specific configuration files must 
end with the associated cluster name.

.BR
.PP
.PP
.PP
By default, the first ten hosts listed in the Host section of 
lsf.cluster.\fIcluster_name\fR are available to LIMs in remote clusters.
.PP
This parameter is useful when LSF_CONFDIR is not shared or 
replicated.

.SH HostType Section
.BR
.PP
.PP
(Required) Lists the valid host types in the cluster 
.SH HostType Section Structure
.BR
.PP
.PP
The first line consists of the mandatory keyword TYPENAME.
.PP
Subsequent lines name valid host types.
.SH TYPENAME 
.BR
.PP
.SS Description
.BR
.PP
.PP
Host type names are usually based on a combination of the hardware 
name and operating system. If your site already has a system for 
naming host types, you can use the same names for openlava.
.SH HostType Section Example
.BR

.SH HostModel Section
.BR
.PP
.PP
(Required) Lists models of machines and gives the relative CPU scaling 
factor for each model 
.PP
openlava uses the relative CPU scaling factor to normalize the CPU load 
indices so that jobs are more likely to be sent to faster hosts. The CPU 
factor affects the calculation of job execution time limits and 
accounting. Using large or inaccurate values for the CPU factor can 
cause confusing results when CPU time limits or accounting are used.
.SH HostModel Section Structure 
.BR
.PP
.PP
The first line consists of the mandatory keywords MODELNAME, 
CPUFACTOR, and ARCHITECTURE.
.PP
Subsequent lines define a model and its CPU factor.
.SH ARCHITECTURE
.BR
.PP
.SS Description
.BR
.PP
.PP
(Reserved for system use only) Indicates automatically detected host 
models that correspond to the model names.
.SH CPUFACTOR
.BR
.PP
.SS Description
.BR
.PP
.PP
Though it is not required, you would typically assign a CPU factor of 
2.0 to the slowest machine model in your system and higher numbers 
for the others. For example, for a machine model that executes at twice 
the speed of your slowest model, a factor of 2.0 should be assigned.
.SH MODELNAME 
.BR
.PP
.SS Description
.BR
.PP
.PP
Generally, you need to identify the distinct host types in your system, 
such as MIPS and SPARC first, and then the machine models within 
each, such as SparcIPC, Sparc1, Sparc2, and Sparc10.

.PP
The type of resource:
.RS
.HP 2
\(bu Boolean--Resources that have a value of 1 on hosts that have the 
resource and 0 otherwise.
.HP 2
\(bu Numeric--Resources that take numerical values, such as all the 
load indices, number of processors on a host, or host CPU factor.
.HP 2
\(bu String-- Resources that take string values, such as host type, host 
model, host status.

.PP
If TYPE is not given, the default type is Boolean. 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR
.PP
.SS Description
.BR
.PP
.PP
Brief description of the resource. 
.PP
The information defined here will be returned by the ls_info() API 
call or printed out by the \fBlsinfo\fR command as an explanation of the 
meaning of the resource.
.SH INCREASING
.BR
.PP
.PP
Applies to numeric resources only.
.SS Description
.BR
.PP
.PP
If a larger value means greater load, INCREASING should be defined 
as Y. If a smaller value means greater load, INCREASING should be 
defined as N.
.SH INTERVAL
.BR
.PP
.PP
Optional. Applies to dynamic resources only.
.SS Description
.BR
.PP
.PP
Defines the time interval (in seconds) at which the resource is sampled 
by the ELIM.
.PP
If INTERVAL is defined for a numeric resource, it becomes an external 
load index.
.SS Default
.BR
.PP
.PP
If INTERVAL is not given, the resource is considered static.
.SH RELEASE
.BR
.PP
.PP
Applies to numeric shared resources only, such as floating licenses.
.SS Description
.BR
.PP
.PP
Controls whether openlava releases the resource when a job using the 
resource is suspended. When a job using a shared resource is 
suspended, the resource is held or released by the job depending on 
the configuration of this parameter.
.PP
Specify N to hold the resource, or specify Y to release the resource.
.SS Default 
.BR
.PP
.PP
Y
