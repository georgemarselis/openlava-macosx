\fBlsb.users\fR
.SS \fB\fROverview
.BR
.PP
.PP
The lsb.users file is used to configure user groups, 
job slot limits for users and 
user groups. 
.PP
This file is optional.
.PP
The lsb.users file is stored in the directory 
LSB_CONFDIR/\fIcluster_name\fR/configdir, where LSB_CONFDIR is 
defined in lsf.conf.

.SH UserGroup Section
.BR
.PP
.PP
Optional. Defines user groups.
.PP
The name of the user group can be used in other user group and queue 
definitions, as well as on the command line. Specifying the name of a 
user group has exactly the same effect as listing the names of all users 
in the group.
.PP
The total number of user groups cannot be more than MAX_GROUPS 
in lsbatch.h.
.SH Structure
.BR
.PP
.PP
The first line consists of two mandatory keywords, GROUP_NAME and 
GROUP_MEMBER. The USER_SHARES keyword is optional. Subsequent 
lines name a group and list its membership and optionally its share 
assignments.
.PP
Each line must contain one entry for each keyword. Use empty 
parentheses () or a dash - to specify the default value for an entry.

End UserGroup

.PP

.SH GROUP_NAME
.BR
.PP
.PP
An alphanumeric string representing the user group name. You cannot 
use the reserved name all or a / in a group name, and group names 
must not conflict with user names. 
.SH GROUP_MEMBER
.BR
.PP
.PP
A list of user names or user group names that belong to the group, 
enclosed in parentheses and separated by spaces. Group names must 
not conflict with user names.
.PP
User and user group names can appear on multiple lines, because users 
can belong to multiple groups.
.PP
User groups may be defined recursively but must not create a loop.
.SS Syntax

\(bu \fIuser_name\fR | \fIuser_group \fR
.RE

.IP
User and user group names, separated by spaces. User names must 
be valid login names. 

.IP
User group names can be openlava user groups defined previously in 
this section, or LINUX groups.

\(bu \fBall\fR

.IP
The reserved name all specifies all users in the cluster. 


.RS
.HP 2
\(bu \fB!\fR
.RE

.IP
The exclamation mark ! specifies that the group membership 
should be retrieved via egroup. 

.SH User Section
.BR
.PP
.PP
Optional. If this section is not defined, all users and user groups can 
run an unlimited number of jobs in the cluster.
.PP
This section defines the maximum number of jobs a user or user group 
can run concurrently in the cluster. This is to avoid situations in which 
a user occupies all or most of the system resources while other users' 
jobs are waiting.
.SH Structure
.BR
.PP
.PP
All three fields are mandatory: USER_NAME, MAX_JOBS, JL/P.
.PP
You must specify a dash (-) to indicate the default value (unlimited) if 
a user or user group is specified. Fields cannot be left blank.

.SH USER_NAME
.BR
.PP
.PP
User or user group for which job slot limits are defined. 
.PP
Use the reserved user name default to specify a job slot limit that 
applies to each user and user group not explicitly named. Since the 
limit specified with the keyword default applies to user groups also, 
ensure you select a limit that is high enough, or explicitly define limits 
for user groups. 
.PP
User group names can be the openlava user groups defined previously, 
and/or LINUX user groups.
.PP
Job slot limits apply to a group as a whole. Append @ to a group name 
to make the job slot limits apply individually to each user in the group. 
If a group contains a subgroup, the job slot limit also applies to each 
member in the subgroup recursively.
.SH MAX_JOBS
.BR
.PP
.PP
Per-user or per-group job slot limit for the cluster. Total number of job 
slots that each user or user group can use in the cluster.
.SH JL/P
.BR
.PP
.PP
Per processor job slot limit per user or user group.
.PP
Total number of job slots that each user or user group can use per 
processor. This job slot limit is configured per processor so that 
multiprocessor hosts will automatically run more jobs.
.PP
This number can be a fraction such as 0.5, so that it can also serve as 
a per-host limit. This number is rounded up to the nearest integer equal 
to or greater than the total job slot limits for a host. For example, if 
JL/P is 0.5, on a 4-CPU multiprocessor host, the user can only use up 
to 2 job slots at any time. On a uniprocessor machine, the user can use 
1 job slot.
